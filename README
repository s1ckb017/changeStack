Simple program to change itself stack. 
It finds through /proc/pid/maps start address and end address of stack
afterwards it creates a memory area of (end_stack - start_stack) bytes and copy all content of stack in memory area before created. 
Finally it swaps values of register rsp and rbp to set registers to new stack values.  
This program works only on x86-64 architecture.
